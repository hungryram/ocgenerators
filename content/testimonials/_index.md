review = "After some fire related power outages, I decided to purchase a whole house back up generator for our 8000 sq ft house.  Found OC via a neighbor who recommended them.  They proved to be very knowledgeable about both the System options and the pros/cons of the city inspection process. I also got bid from 3 companies and they were most price competitive.  They were also very upfront about ALL the costs and challenges involved.\n\nThe installation went very smoothly, and they've been very responsive to any questions I've had since.  They are also doing the recurring maintenance on the unit for a very reasonable price.  \n\nRecommend highly!"
