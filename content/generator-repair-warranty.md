You invested in a Generac automatic home backup generator, and now youâ€™re never without power. But just like a car, air-cooled backup generators need to be properly maintained to perform as intended. We recommend you have your unit serviced every 6 months. Our factory-trained technicians are available to handle all your Generac servicing needs.

If you are looking for the Owner's Manual for your generator (or any other Generac equipment), please use the online product support on the Generac.com website. You can use your model number or serial number to find your manual by using the form located here: [http://www.generac.com/service-support/product-support-lookup](http://www.generac.com/service-support/product-support-lookup "http://www.generac.com/service-support/product-support-lookup")

For questions about the warranty of your Generac generator (or other Generac equipment), please contact Generac directly at 888-GENERAC (888-436-3722)

To ensure accurate warranty coverage, please make sure your Generac equipment is registered at [https://register.generac.com](https://register.generac.com "https://register.generac.com")

An added benefit of registering is proof-of-purchase in the event of an insurance loss such as fire, flood or theft.
